## Introduction

In the landscape of web application development, choosing the right architecture is crucial for a robust and secure user experience. In this article, I share my perspective on developing web applications using the .NET environment, with a focus on security, control, and a server-centric approach.

## Server-Centric Philosophy

My development philosophy revolves around placing a strong emphasis on server-side control and management. By centralizing the state, logic, and interactions on the server, I aim to enhance security, protect against potential threats, and maintain a consistent user experience.

## Choice of Technology

I've chosen to leverage the .NET environment, utilizing tools such as Blazor Server and Razor interfaces (complemented by HTMX) technology for dynamic client-server interactions. This combination allows me to strike a balance between delivering dynamic user experiences and maintaining a server-centric architecture.

## Security First

The primary motivation behind my approach is the paramount importance of security. By keeping critical logic and state management on the server, I gain greater control over request handling, user authorization, and data privacy. This minimizes the risk of client-side vulnerabilities and potential tampering attempts.

## User Equality and Rule Enforcement

My development philosophy prioritizes treating all users equally and enforcing site rules consistently. By relying on server-side control, I mitigate the risk of users attempting to manipulate client-side controls, ensuring a fair and secure user environment.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

Handling sensitive data is a key consideration, and my approach facilitates the implementation of secure data handling practices. This not only enhances data privacy but also ensures compliance with relevant regulations, making the application trustworthy and reliable.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my approach to web application development in the .NET environment revolves around achieving a secure, server-centric architecture. By carefully choosing technologies and emphasizing control, I aim to deliver web applications that not only provide dynamic and engaging user experiences but also prioritize the security and integrity of user data.
