*Unlocking the Role of a Web Programmer*

Understanding the distinction between a programmer and a developer is crucial. A programmer serves as the bedrock of programming, possessing in-depth expertise in coding, problem-solving, and algorithm development. On the other hand, a developer operates at a higher level, specializing in specific fields while mastering a diverse array of tools. Some perceive the developer's role as more comprehensive due to this breadth of knowledge.
